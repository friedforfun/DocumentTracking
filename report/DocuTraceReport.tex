\section{Introduction}

\section{Requirements Checklist}
\emph{Here you should clearly show which requirements you have delivered andwhich you haven’t.}

\section{Design Considerations}
\emph{Here you should clearly state what you have done to your application tomake it more usable and accessible.}

\section{User Guide}
\emph{Use screen shots of the running application along with text descriptions to help youdescribe how to operate the application.}

\section{Developer Guide}
\emph{Describe your application design and main areas of code in order to help another developer understand your work and how they might develop it. You may find it useful to supplementthe text with code fragments.}

\section{Testing}
\emph{Show  the  results  for  testing  all  cases  and  prove  that  the  outputs  are  what  are  expected.Preferably,  use  unit  testing  to  test  core  functionality  of  the  implementation.   If  certain  conditionscause erroneous results or the application to crash then report these honestly.}

\section{Personal Development}
\emph{A short discussion on lessons learnt from the feedback given on CW1and a discussion how you integrated this feedback into CW2.  Cover both coding and report writing,possibly more (project management, preparing for interview style questions etc).}

\section{Conclusions}
\emph{Reflect on what you are most proud of in the application and what you’d have likedto have done differently.  You should reflect on the produced software, and compare software devel-opment in scripting vs.  systems languages.}
